User can create a library, adding books that she wants to read along with certain details such as author, number of pages, etc.  User can toggle the "read" status to indicate whether or not she has read the book. 
Books can be added and removed, and the read status can be updated from unread to in-progress to read.
Additionally, user can indicate if she recommends the book or is unsure (the default value for books added to the library is "unsure").
A filter is available to show books based on read status recommendation status.
